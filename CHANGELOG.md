## 0.0.2

- Default `ctaLabel` changed from trial-specific text to generic `'Get Started'`.
- Default `title` changed to `'Go Premium'`.
- Fixed `SmoothPaywallTheme.light()` — now returns real light palette (white/gray background, dark text).

- Active subscription banner: text is now white (uses `bodyStyle.color`), icon has no background.

- Close button and bottom action labels use theme colors — compatible with both light and dark mode.
- Added `isSubscribed`, `subscriptionExpiryDate`, `subscribedCtaLabel`, `subscribedStatusLabel` params.
- CTA button disabled (not hidden) when `isSubscribed` is true.
